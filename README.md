# Todo board with DND functionality  

## Idea:  
- TypeScript 
- MUI components
- Drag & Drop (react-dnd)
- Page router
- Custom back end (NodeJS, Express)

## Known issues
- Cannot update tasks' content after creation 
- Current user is not showing after a successful login (page refresh required)

## Backend (in process)
View back end repository [here](https://github.com/isemilia/task-management-backend).
