# Todo board with DND functionality  

## Idea:  
- TypeScript 
- MUI components
- Drag & Drop (react-dnd)
- Page router
- Custom back end (NodeJS, Express)

## Known issues
- Cannot update tasks' content after creation 
- Current user is not showing after a successful login (page refresh required)
- When you visit the app for the first time, it might take a long time to load. That's because I'm using a free plan to host the backend, so it comes with various limitations
- Logging in after a log out requires a page refresh to work

## Backend (in process)
